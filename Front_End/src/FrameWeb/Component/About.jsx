          <h4>ABOUT US</h4>
          <p>On *15th August 2025, We‚ÄîSamarth, Shree, Sachin, and Sandeep‚Äîturned a shared passion into a bold business idea:
            to create a framing company that delivers more than just frames‚Äîit delivers *clarity and quality in every memory.

            We called it *Infinity*‚Äîa name that reflects timeless moments and limitless creativity.

            With no outside funding and just a clean website, we launched their web-based platform,
            focused on what most companies overlooked: *perfect image clarity and top-tier frame quality*.
            Customers could upload their photos, select a frame style, and get museum-grade prints shipped directly to their door.

            Our *secret to success? A deep commitment to doing one thing better than anyone else‚Äînever compromising on quality or clarity*,
            no matter the cost.

            Word spread quickly. In just weeks, Infinity earned a reputation for delivering frames that didn‚Äôt just look good‚Äîthey felt right.
            Customers returned, not just for products, but for the trust Infinity built around preserving life‚Äôs most important moments.

            What started as a shared dream between four friends is now a rising brand built on precision, passion, and a promise:
            *every memory deserves to be framed perfectly*.
